# FEDDA Hub v2.0

FEDDA Hub v2.0 is the modular distribution branch for a workflow-first local AI studio.

## v2.0 scope

The core UI stays focused on five areas:

- Image Studio
- Video Studio
- Gallery, with images and videos together
- LoRA & Character
- Ollama Models

Workflow families are being separated into core and booster modules so the app can stay usable even when an optional model pack or custom node set is not installed.

Current module ownership lives in:

```text
config\modules.json
```

v2.0 builds on the clean repo + install separation. The modular foundation (core + boosters) is in place. Modules describe ownership and guide installer node selection. RunPod and Docker deployment support is included for easy cloud usage.

## Install layout

For local staging, put the one-click installer in any folder you want to use as the install root. The installer creates:

```text
<your chosen folder>\
  FEDDA_v2.0_Installer.bat
  app\                 # local runtime install target, ignored by git
  logs\                # installer logs
```

The single-file installer clones or updates:

```text
https://github.com/Feddakalkun/Fedda_hub_v2.0
```

into `app/`, then runs `scripts\install.bat LITE`.

Current active features include:
- Image + Video Studios (with visual card picker)
- Gallery
- LoRA & Character management
- Ollama models
- ControlNet (Depth + OpenPose)
- **Venice.ai** integration where applicable

That same repository is the active v2.0 development remote.

## RunPod / Docker Support

The `runpod/` folder and Docker files make it easy to deploy on RunPod.io or run in containers. More details in `runpod/TEMPLATE_SETUP.md` and `readme/RUNPOD_SETUP.md`.

## Runtime policy

Runtime and generated assets are not committed:

- `ComfyUI/`
- `python_embeded/`
- `venv/`
- `node_modules/`
- `ollama_embeded/`
- model folders and model binaries
- cache, logs, temp, output folders

The installer bootstraps those locally.

## Development checks

From the repo folder:

```powershell
cd <your repo folder>
.\scripts\smoke_clean_install.ps1
cd frontend
npm.cmd run build
```

Module manifest checks:

```powershell
python -m py_compile backend\module_service.py backend\server.py
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". .\scripts\module_nodes.ps1; Get-FeddaNodeConfig -RootPath (Get-Location).Path"
```
